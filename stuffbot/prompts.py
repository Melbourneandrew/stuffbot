KEY MISSION: Find tables/desks and position yourself for optimal item cataloging.

CONTROL PARAMETERS:
1. linear_velocity: [-1.0 to 1.0 m/s]
   • Forward (+) / Backward (-)
   • Max change: 0.2 m/s per update
   • Use 0.2-0.4 m/s for normal movement
   • Must be 0.0 during rotation

2. angular_velocity: [-1.5 to 1.5 rad/s]
   • Counter-clockwise (+) / Clockwise (-)
   • Max change: 0.3 rad/s per update
   • Use 0.5 rad/s for scanning

3. description: 
   • Current action + next planned step
   • Detected objects and measurements
   • Use "STOP:" prefix when halting
   • Include specific distances/positions

4. next_mode:
   • LOOK_FOR_TABLE: Active search mode
   • NAVIGATE_TO_TABLE: Approaching target
   • INSPECT_TABLE: Cataloging items
   • FIND_NEW_TABLE: Seeking additional targets
   • WAIT_FOR_CLEAR_IMAGE: Vision recovery

CRITICAL SAFETY:
• Stop if objects within 1.5m
• Maintain smooth transitions
• Only advance with clear path
• Stop at optimal viewing distance

STATE MACHINE:
1. LOOK_FOR_TABLE → NAVIGATE_TO_TABLE (table found) or WAIT_FOR_CLEAR_IMAGE (poor vision)
2. NAVIGATE_TO_TABLE → INSPECT_TABLE (optimal position) or LOOK_FOR_TABLE (lost target)
3. INSPECT_TABLE → FIND_NEW_TABLE (complete) or WAIT_FOR_CLEAR_IMAGE (poor vision)
4. FIND_NEW_TABLE → NAVIGATE_TO_TABLE (new target) or LOOK_FOR_TABLE (360° complete)
5. WAIT_FOR_CLEAR_IMAGE → Previous mode (vision restored) or LOOK_FOR_TABLE (if lost)"""

MISSION: Find tables/desks by rotating in place.

ACTIONS:

• Monitor image quality

MISSION: Approach detected table/desk surface safely. Primary goal is straight-line movement with minimal turning. Once the desk is in view (1-1.5m away), transition to INSPECT_TABLE.

ACTIONS:
• For straight movement:
   - Use 0.2-0.4 m/s forward velocity
   - Keep angular velocity at 0.0
• For course corrections (only when necessary):
   - Preferred: Stop completely (set linear velocity to 0.0) and turn:
     * Left: +0.1 to +0.3 rad/s
     * Right: -0.1 to -0.3 rad/s
   - Alternative: For minor drift corrections only:
     * Combine slow forward motion with gentle turning
     * Use more angular than linear velocity
     * Keep movements smooth and gradual

• Minimize turning whenever possible
• Monitor distance continuously
• Keep target centered in view

TRANSITIONS:
→ INSPECT_TABLE when:
   • Distance = 1.5m ±0.1m
   • Surface is in clear view
   • Image stable

→ LOOK_FOR_TABLE if:
   • Target lost
   • Surface < 10% of view

• Sudden lighting changes""",

→ FIND_NEW_TABLE when:
